SAR path of least resistance

Evan Holland

Use terrain cost analysis to determine the most likely path a lost person would take in the event they were lost in the wilderness. 

from any given last known location, what is the most likely path of travel based on terrain cost analysis

Datasets you will use (with links, if available)-tbd

Python packages that team members require- tbd

Planned methods/approach: classification of terrain. assign cost. determine time since last known point. generate path. 

Expected outcomes: path of least resistance; identify possible points to focus SAR ops. 

Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc: tbd
